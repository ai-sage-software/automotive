A standard **invoice** is used to document the sale of a part, and it is commonly referred to as a **"Parts Invoice"** or **"Counter Ticket"** (especially when a part is sold directly to a customer or an outside repair shop without any related labor being performed by the dealership/shop).

### How Invoices are Used for Parts

1.  **Direct Sale to Customer/Shop:**
    * If a customer or an independent repair shop purchases a replacement part (e.g., a set of brake pads, a filter, a headlight bulb) from the dealership's parts counter without having the dealership install it, the transaction is finalized with a document usually titled **"Parts Invoice"** or simply **"Invoice."**
    * This document serves as the formal record of sale, proof of payment, and is necessary for any warranty claims on that specific part.

2.  **Internal Use (Parts used in a Repair):**
    * When a part is installed as part of a repair service, the initial work is tracked on a document called a **Repair Order (RO)** or **Work Order**.
    * The **Repair Order** documents the customer complaint, the labor performed, and the parts used. The final financial document presented to the customer, which includes both the labor charges and the itemized parts charges, is often called the **Auto Repair Invoice** or **Final Invoice**.
    * Within the dealer's system, the parts department may create an **internal "Parts Invoice"** to transfer the part from inventory to the service department's job cost (the Repair Order), but the customer usually only sees the final, consolidated invoice.

In summary, whether it's the standalone document for a parts-only sale or a section on a larger repair bill, the final document requesting or confirming payment for vehicle components is a type of **invoice**, and referring to it as a **"Parts Invoice"** is standard industry practice.
