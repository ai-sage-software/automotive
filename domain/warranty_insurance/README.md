# Warranty & Insurance

Welcome to the **Warranty & Insurance** domain.

If you are new to the system, think of this domain as the **"Risk Management and Claims Office."** Its primary purpose is to manage the processes and data related to vehicle warranties (promises made by the manufacturer) and, implicitly, any related insurance products sold to customers.

This domain is essential for honoring manufacturer commitments, managing dealer liability, and ensuring the customer receives covered repairs without bearing the cost.

## 📂 How to Navigate This Directory

We have organized the information around the two core concepts: defining the coverage and processing the request for compensation (the claim).

## 🛡️ Core Concepts (The API)

In the **[`/api`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./api)** folder, you will find the definitions central to risk and coverage.

### 1\. The Claim Process

* **[`warranty_claim`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./api/warranty_claim)**: The central Aggregate Root (AR) of this domain. This is the formal request for reimbursement submitted to the manufacturer for covered repair work performed by the dealer. It includes the job details, parts used, and labor hours.
* **[`claim_status`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./api/claim_status)**: Tracks the lifecycle of the claim (e.g., `Submitted`, `Under Review`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Reimbursed`).

### 2\. Coverage & Eligibility (Implied)

While the diagram only shows the `Claim` component, effective warranty management requires:

* **Coverage Rules:** Data defining what is covered, for how long (time and mileage), and under what conditions (e.g., is routine maintenance covered?).
* **Vehicle History Check:** Using the **[Vehicle Service History](https://www.google.com/search?q=../domains/service_parts/README.md)** to ensure the issue was not caused by previous unauthorized modifications.

-----

## ✅ Claims Adjudication (The Specs)

The **[`/specs`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./specs)** folder details the strict, often manufacturer-mandated, rules for processing claims. Failure to follow these rules results in the dealer not getting reimbursed.

* **Eligibility Logic:** Specs detailing the complex rules for validating a claim against the warranty terms (e.g., "Did the customer miss a required service interval, thus voiding the warranty?").
* **Labor Rate Compliance:** Rules ensuring the service department bills labor hours at the pre-approved manufacturer rate, not the standard retail rate.
* **Reimbursement Flow:** The process that sends the approved **[Invoice](https://www.google.com/search?q=../finance/README.md)** to the manufacturer and tracks the expected payment receipt.

## 🔗 Domain Relationships

Warranty Management is an execution domain, consuming data from Service to initiate the claim and relying on Finance to track the money.

* **Service, Repair & Parts:** The `Warranty Claim` is initiated when a **[Repair Order](https://www.google.com/search?q=../domains/service_parts/README.md)** is flagged as covered by a warranty. The claim consumes data (labor codes, parts used) directly from the Service Order.
* **Party & Identity Management:** We check the **[Customer Profile](https://www.google.com/search?q=../domains/party_identity/README.md)** to validate the legal owner of the vehicle making the claim.
* **Financial & Payments:** An approved `Warranty Claim` creates a receivable in the **[Finance](https://www.google.com/search?q=../finance/README.md)** domain—money the manufacturer owes the dealership.
* **Telematics & Vehicle Events:** Diagnostic data from the **[Telematics](https://www.google.com/search?q=../domains/telematics/README.md)** domain (like vehicle mileage at the time of failure) can be used to prove or disprove a claim's validity.

## 🚀 Getting Started Checklist

If you are working with warranty processes, accuracy is key:

1.  **The Core:** Review the **[`warranty_claim`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./api/warranty_claim)** schema to understand what data points are required for a successful submission to the OEM.
2.  **The Trigger:** Understand how a **[Repair Order](https://www.google.com/search?q=../domains/service_parts/README.md)** status change initiates the claim process in this domain.
3.  **The Money:** Trace how an approved claim eventually creates a transaction in the **[Financial](https://www.google.com/search?q=../finance/README.md)** ledger.

*For issues regarding the reimbursement of a paid claim, please follow up with the **[Financial & Payments](https://www.google.com/search?q=../finance/README.md)** domain team.*
