Welcome to the **STAR Legacy Domain Repostory**.

This repository contains Domain models that were developed prior to the NEW STAR Domain Model.
The new STAR Domail Model is begin developed using the Domain Driven Design development approach.

Under this "legacy" folder there is a "domain" sub-folder that contains the legacy API information. 
* Service APIs that were converted from the STAR XML schema repository
* STAR APis that were already published prior to the new STAR Domain Model architecture will be available soon. 


This document will guide you through the structure of this service repository and explain the core concepts we model.

The Service Domain, originally developed in the STAR5 XML Schema Repository, has been migrated into these OpenAPI specifications. This domain is currently undergoing harmonization with the new STAR Domain Model architecture. As you explore the Service Domain, we eagerly anticipate your feedback on how this domain can be further enhanced.
