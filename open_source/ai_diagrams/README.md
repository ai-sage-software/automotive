# AI Diagrams

Welcome to the **AI Diagrams** project documentation.

This project provides a suite of tools leveraging AI to **automate the generation, maintenance, and synchronization of architectural and domain diagrams** across our Automotive Retail Platform. In a rapidly evolving system with many interconnected domains, manually updating diagrams (like UML, C4, or entity-relationship models) becomes a significant bottleneck, often leading to outdated or inaccurate documentation. This project ensures our visual documentation is always a true reflection of our codebase and domain models.

## 🎯 Goal and Scope

The primary goal is to **maintain accurate, up-to-date, and accessible visual documentation** of our system architecture and domain models with minimal manual effort, fostering better understanding and alignment across teams.

### Key Benefits

* **Accuracy:** Diagrams are generated directly from source code, API schemas, or structured specifications, eliminating human error.
* **Efficiency:** Reduces the time and effort spent by architects and developers on diagram creation and updates.
* **Consistency:** Enforces a standardized visual language (e.g., PlantUML, C4 model syntax) across all documentation.
* **Accessibility:** Makes complex system structures easier for new team members (like those using these READMEs\!) to understand.

## 🛠️ Core Components

The project includes modules for parsing various input formats and generating different diagram types.

### 1\. Code & Schema Parser

This module analyzes source code and API definitions to extract structural information.

* **API Schema Analyzer:** Reads OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications (e.g., from **[Finance API](https://github.com/ai-sage-software/automotive/tree/main/finance/api/README.md)** or **[PIM API](https://github.com/ai-sage-software/automotive/tree/main/domain/finance/domains/party_identity/api/README.md)**) to identify entities, relationships, and data types.
* **Codebase Scanner:** Integrates with static analysis tools to understand class structures, method calls, and module dependencies within our services.

### 2\. Diagram Generator Engine

This component takes the parsed information and renders it into a visual format.

* **PlantUML Renderer:** Generates `PlantUML` syntax from the parsed data, which can then be converted into various image formats (PNG, SVG). This is often used for sequence diagrams and class diagrams.
* **C4 Model Builder:** Specifically designed to create C4 model diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code views) that visually represent system architecture at different levels of abstraction.
* **Entity Relationship (ERD) Generator:** Creates diagrams that show how data entities (e.g., **[Deal](https://github.com/ai-sage-software/automotive/tree/main/domain/finance/sales_operations/README.md)**, **[Vehicle](https://github.com/ai-sage-software/automotive/tree/main/domain/finance./domains/inventory_vehicle/README.md)**, **[Customer Profile](https://github.com/ai-sage-software/automotive/tree/main/domain/finance./domains/party_identity/README.md)**) are related in our databases.

### 3\. LLM-Assisted Refinement (AI Integration)

This module leverages **[ai\_llm\_models](https://github.com/ai-sage-software/automotive/tree/main/domain/finance./ai_llm_models/README.md)** to improve diagram clarity and add intelligent annotations.

* **Natural Language to Diagram:** Allows users to describe a desired diagram (e.g., "Show me the data flow from Telematics to Service") and the LLM helps translate that into generator commands or refines existing diagrams.
* **Contextual Labeling:** Uses LLMs to suggest clearer labels or group related components based on their inferred function.

-----

## 🔗 Integration and Usage

This project is a vital tool for technical documentation, architectural reviews, and developer onboarding.

* **README Integration:** The diagrams embedded within these `README.md` files (like the example above) are often generated by this tool, pulling from the domain's API schemas and **[`model_diagrams`]( #))** folder.
* **Automated Documentation CI/CD:** Integrated into our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines to regenerate and update diagrams whenever relevant code or schema changes are merged.
* **Architectural Review:** Architects use this tool to quickly visualize the impact of proposed changes across multiple domains before implementation.

### Example Generation Command

```bash
 
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from documentation specialists, visual designers, and AI/ML engineers. Please consult the root `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

### Roadmap Focus Areas

* Adding support for generating dynamic "live" diagrams that reflect the current state of deployed microservices.
* Developing a web-based GUI for interactive diagram exploration and real-time editing of generated outputs.
* Enhancing LLM integration to allow for automatic summarization and explanation of complex diagram sections.
