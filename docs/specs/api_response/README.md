## API response
Tipalti uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In case of success, an API call returns a JSON response body that includes information about the resource.

2xx range codes: indicate success
4xx range codes: indicate an error given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was missing, a parameter value was invalid failed, etc.)
5xx range codes: indicate an internal error within Tipalti’s servers
